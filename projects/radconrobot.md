summary: "My team worked on an ongoing project to create a robot that could perform simple radiological surveys through remote operation."
---

The goal of the Radcon Robot is to make performance of large scale radiological surveys simpler and less strenuous for technicians. There are routine radiological surveys performed
by the Radiological Monitoring Division of the Navy that measure and record radiation levels in the environment. This data is used to ensure the safe operation of nuclear power plants.
Some of these surveys require large areas to be surveyed within a reasonable time frame. Primarily that requires one technician per instrument for many hours of a day. The robot is 
able to take the place of several technicians at once, does not get tired or bored, and provides repeatable data points. This will drastically save cost and resources when the robot is 
fully implemented.
