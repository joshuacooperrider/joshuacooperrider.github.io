# Reusing the Wisdom of Software Architects

Picture a city skyline. Gleaming towers of glass and steel rise from the earth, each a unique monument to its architect's vision. Yet beneath the artistry lies something more universal: a collection of time-tested blueprints and principles that guide the placement of beams, the structure of floors, and the flow of space. No matter how original a building appears, it still leans on patterns that have proven effective over centuries.

In software development, design patterns are our blueprints. They are not rigid rules but reusable solutions to recurring problems. They do not dictate the shape of our application, just as an architectural pattern doesn’t mandate the façade. Instead, they provide guidance on how to structure components, manage interactions, and promote clarity and efficiency in our work.

Much like how a skyscraper might use a cantilever system to elegantly support an overhang, a developer might use the Observer pattern to enable one part of an application to react to changes in another—say, updating a UI component when data changes in a store. This pattern acts like a nervous system: when a nerve fires, all connected muscles respond.

Take the Singleton pattern, often maligned for its potential overuse, has proven helpful in moderation. A logging service for an application that has to write events to a file or external database. Making this logger a Singleton ensured that only one instance exists across the app, simplifying configuration and avoiding conflicts.

Design patterns are not magic bullets; they’re more like architectural wisdom passed from one engineer to the next. They help us avoid reinventing the wheel and instead focus our creative energy where it matters. When I reach for a design pattern, I’m not just solving a problem—I’m standing on the shoulders of those who solved similar problems decades before me.

So when an interviewer asks, "What are design patterns?" they’re really asking if you know how to build with more than bricks—they want to see if you can shape a skyline.
