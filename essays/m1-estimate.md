# Project Milestone Estimation

Estimation is an essential element to successful project deployment. It serves as the foundation for planning, resource allocation, and progress tracking. In the context of Milestone 1, developing accurate estimates helped us better understand the scope of our tasks and set realistic expectations for ourselves and our team.

This reflection outlines how our estimates were formed, the insights we gained through the process, and the personal strategies I used to stay organized and accountable. While the journey was not without its challenges, it provided meaningful lessons about balancing precision with flexibility in a collaborative software development environment.

### How Estimates Were Created

Effort estimates were based on prior experience throughout the course—particularly from building pages in Next.js, completing WODs, and gauging overall familiarity with the tools and technologies involved. Additional buffer time was included to accommodate unexpected complications and integration efforts with other branches.

### Usefulness of Estimation

While our estimates were not flawless, they proved to be highly valuable. They offered insight into how future estimations can be more accurate and helped reinforce accountability in completing tasks and resolving issues in a timely manner.

Effort estimation also played a vital role in team coordination. It helped ensure that work was distributed proportionally, avoided potential bottlenecks, and revealed when a team member might require additional support. For instance, if one individual consistently missed estimates while others stayed on track, it became easier to identify underlying issues and intervene constructively.

### Personal Tracking Method

My own tracking approach was informal yet effective. I mentally monitored the time I spent on each issue, beginning from the moment I engaged with the task to when I completed it. This included time spent on research and planning in addition to actual coding.

As a full-time student, employee, and husband, my working time was often fragmented. To stay organized, I made brief note entries on my desktop whenever I had to step away. These notes summarized my current progress, next steps, and total time spent so far—allowing me to quickly resume work with minimal friction.

### Final Thoughts

Estimating effort is as much an art as it is a science. Even when the outcomes don't perfectly match the initial predictions, the act of estimating still adds tremendous value. It encourages intentional planning, fosters accountability, and sharpens our understanding of both individual and team capacity. Moving forward, I plan to refine my estimation techniques by incorporating what I’ve learned—staying mindful of where time is actually spent, and how that aligns with expectations.
