*Are UI Frameworks Worth the Learning Curve?*

## Introduction

Do you remember your first language class? I certainly don't. I remember it was a Spanish class I took back in 
middle school. I can tell you that I probably can count how much Spanish I know on all my digits. Part of that 
is because, at the time, I just took it because it was required, not because of some forsight on its 
usefulness or application. If I had planned on going into a career that was heavily involved with the Spanish 
language then I probably would have remembered and become much more fluid in it and find it easy and trivial
today. So what does this have to do with using UI frameworks?

## The Language of Learning

Learning any new way to do something is much like learning a new language. It may seem difficult and 
frustrating at first, but given time, effort, and dedication it can become second nature. Using a developement 
tool such as bootstrap comes with its own learning curve but in time the benefits of using such tools become 
self evident. Take the following screenshots as an example:

The left screenshot is from an official website: https://www.kohanarum.com/. The right screenshot is a 
recreation I made in 45 min using the Bootstrap5 framework. As you can see, developer tools such as Bootstrap 
can allow a user to do some incredible things. The same thing could be achieved using only HTML and CSS 
formats but Bootstrap sets up an easy to understand format for creating/recreating websites that are easy on 
the eyes.

## Conclusion

Predefined styles, grid systems, and components provided by frameworks like Bootstrap speed up the process and 
provide reliable formats for designing websites. They also allow easy layouts that can be used across multiple 
screen sizes without the need of extensive CSS media queries. When working in teams, UI frameworks allow for 
consistency accross the project. Everything that bootstrap does can be done in CSS, however, why reinvent the 
wheel?
