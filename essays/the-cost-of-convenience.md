*Are UI Frameworks Worth the Learning Curve?*

## Introduction

Do you remember your first language class? I certainly don't. I remember it was a Spanish class I took back in 
middle school. I can tell you that I probably can count how much Spanish I know on all my digits. Part of that 
is because, at the time, I just took it because it was required, not because of some forsight on its 
usefulness or application. If I had planned on going into a career that was heavily involved with the Spanish 
language then I probably would have remembered and become much more fluid in it and find it easy and trivial
today. So what does this have to do with using UI frameworks?

## The Language of Learning

Learning any new way to do something is much like learning a new language. It may seem difficult and 
frustrating at first, but given time, effort, and dedication it can become second nature.
