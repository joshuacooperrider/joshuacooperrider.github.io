    <h1>Asking the Right Questions</h1>
    <img width="300px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/smart-questions/rtfm.png">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Have you ever wondered why your question on a forum goes unanswered or your responses are not so helpful? It might be because the question proposed wasn't written for your audience. Most people answering questions on forums are doing so out of the goodness of their hearts. A question that makes it sound like you haven't done your research or sounds like you're trolling will probably go ignored. It's important to understand how asking a question the right way can vastly improve the answers you get.</p>

    <h2>What does a good question look like?</h2>
    <p>Stack Overflow, a question and answer site for programmers, has plenty of examples of how to write a smart question that will receive good responses. Take the following example:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
Question: C# var vs. interface vs. concrete class in object instantiation

As we know, there are (at least) four ways to instantiate a class object in C#. But I've never quite understood why some ways are better than others.

First of all, you can explicitly declare the variable as the concrete class and instantiate it as follows (this appears to be the practice of many general developers):

Customer cust = new Customer();

The redundancy of this approach has always bothered me. (Why do we need to be told twice that the object we're creating is a Customer?)

Secondly, there is the newer shorthand version of this approach, which I find much easier on my eyes:

Customer cust = new();

Thirdly, there is var.

var cust = new Customer();

And finally, one can code to the interface rather than the concrete class (assuming we have an interface ICustomer that Customer implements):

ICustomer cust = new Customer();

This pattern is frequently used by Java programmers.

The vast majority of the time I use var. But I am beginning to rethink this. It seems that there is a lot of wisdom in the fourth (Java-style) approach of coding to an interface, as it would be more dependency-injection friendly and allow one to more easily substitute out different implementations of the object.

Can you think of any reason why a developer would use the explicit first approach, as opposed to the shorthand version, or var, or an interface? Or is this all just a matter of style and opinion?

    <p>Can you tell why this is a good question? It shows that the user asking the question has a background in the subject. It also shows that the user is:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
A: datetime and the datetime.timedelta classes are your friend.

1. find today
2. use that to find the first day of this month.
3. use timedelta to backup a single day, to the last day of the previous month.
4. print the YYYYMM string you're looking for.

Like this:

 >>> import datetime
 >>> today = datetime.date.today()
 >>> first = datetime.date(day=1, month=today.month, year=today.year)
 >>> lastMonth = first - datetime.timedelta(days=1)
 >>> print lastMonth.strftime("%Y%m")
 201202
 >>>
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The asker received six possible answers, and he or she was successful in inciting discussion from multiple users. The answers themselves were clear and were devoid of the rumored sarcasm and hostility of “hackers.” Since I myself have referenced this page and found it useful, I can confidently say that it is a good question.</p>

    <h2>The foolproof way to get ignored.</h2>
    <p>While there are decent questions that benefit everyone, there are those one can ask to create an entirely different effect. In the following example, a user asks how he would, in short, create a desktop application with Facebook.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
Q: Facebook Desktop Notifier

I am a beginner programmer that have never used anything other than what's included in a language.

I am trying to create a desktop application that notifies me anytime I get an update on Facebook. 
How should go about doing this? Thanks in advance.

edit Sorry I was not clear. Is there any way to make a DESKTOP application with Facebook?
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>A simple “yes” would have answered the question, but we know that’s not the sort of answer he or she is looking for. Fortunately, someone kindly responded with a link to Facebook’s developer website. The asker should have done more research on his or her potential project. Then further down the road, he or she could have asked more specific and detailed questions that wouldn’t require a thousand-paged response for a sufficient answer.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.</p>
