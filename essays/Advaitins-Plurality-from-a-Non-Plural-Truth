  Welcome to my critical analysis of the Advaitins origin of plurality and levels of reality. The idea behind the Advaitins is that all things are of a singular form called Brahman and that all plurality is an illusion. This illusion is called Maya. Ironically in describing the nature of reality it must be described within its plurality however the fundamental nature of reality is non-plural. I will analyze this contradiction further but first I would like to delve deeper into what the Advaitins levels of reality are.
	In describing the origin of the plural nature of the universe, and of reality itself, the metaphor of the rope and the snake can be used to put a perspective on reality. A rope sitting in a dark room appears to be a snake lying in wake but once light illuminates the room it is revealed that the snake is the rope. In this metaphor the darkness is ignorance and the light is understanding. The rope and snake are an example of Brahman and its “power” of Maya.  
	Now imposing that Brahman has a power in and of itself presents us with an issue. If it has a power would that power not be separate from Brahman, thus making a dualistic comparison? If Nirguna Brahman has no attributes, if it is solely oneness, then giving it a power transforms it into Saguna Brahman, or in other words a oneness with attributes. Saguna Brahman is often considered a lesser form of thought or lesser form of enlightenment, however I disagree with this notion. 
	The term lesser or greater implies duality in and of itself but I believe that this notion can be dissolved by another. The metaphor I refer to one with three blind philosophers and an elephant. The only way the philosophers are able to describe the elephant is in what they are able to observe through touching it. Each one experiences an entirely different interpretation of what the elephant is but they are all describing the same fundamental thing, only limited to the confines of their experience and ability to put such experience into words. Much like the three blind philosophers are limited by circumstance so too are we humans limited by ours. We exist as Maya, or as the illusion cast by Brahman, and so to describe Brahman we must give it attributes because that is what we understand. So my conclusion on this notion of Nirguna and Saguna Brahman is that we aren’t imposing duality on Brahman but merely using it to explain reality in the way that we can observe it. If Nirguna Brahman could be explained without human attribute descriptions, there would be no need to explain it, hence there would no longer be a debate.
	This notion that all plurality in the world is only an illusion presents us with another dilemma. What is morally right? Why must I differentiate when I know that everything is one? I think this can best be made apparent with calculus of all things. In calculus there are functions that at first glance its nature is not apparent, for example; is the function increasing in nature or decreasing in nature? Does it concave up or down? There is an elegant solution to figuring out how the shape of a function looks without having to plot the function and that is by differentiation. Differentiation looks at a specific point and tells you the nature of the graph at that point, what is happening directly before and after that point, and what the shape is at that point. In contrast the idea of integration takes the attributes of a specific point and creates a baseline for the entire function. Granted these are oversimplifications of the concepts since this is philosophy and not a math class but none the less the same principle can be applied. We, as creatures inhabiting this reality with only illusionary qualities must also describe the nature of reality using illusionary attributes to integrate these separate characteristics into a single form of reality.
	With this nature and describing this nature in mind I circle back to the question of morality. Using the rope-snake metaphor I present to you a question: what if instead of the rope being the true object it were actually a snake that you perceive as a rope in the dark? The truth is that until the lights get turned on it doesn’t matter one way or the other, what matters is how you treat it within the reality you exist in. When you know Brahman you become Brahman but if I can perceive you and you can perceive plurality then you are not Brahman and operate accordingly to the reality you reside in. Basically, if while in the darkness you treat the object you perceive cautiously, with respect, and with care, then whether it is actually a rope or snake does not matter, either way you won’t get bit. However if you treat that object without respect then the ignorance imposed upon you by the nature of the darkness could be your undoing. Until illumination is gained operating in the realm of morality is necessary.  
	So what are the practical implications and complications of a belief in this? If everything is one, if I am you and you are me, then why should I have morals or ethics? Well before answering this question let’s look at some complications that arise. If I truly believe that the role of ethics and morals is pointless then a sense of nihilism, arrogance, and egotism could fester within me. If I see myself outside of the illusion of Maya then I have elevated myself to something “superior” to that of the illusion. However in doing this have I not just created more plurality? If I view Maya as separate from Brahman then does that duality not contradict the entire belief that I have based my superiority on?
	I will argue that this concept is inherently flawed. A more nuanced concept is that ethics and morals exist because you exist in this illusion. Understanding that something is an illusion alone does not make the illusion go away or even make it less “real”. Take for example a movie you love to watch. While watching the movie you know it is a fabrication. Every event in the movie is staged. Every conversation rehearsed. Even the images you’re watching are just a series of lights flickering on and off to produce the images. But in watching the movie do you not feel the pull of emotions it intends on provoking? Do you not get a sense of joy, sadness, hope, or motivation from watching this movie? You know it’s not real but yet the impact has real meaning. An illusion can even change the entire course of your life. A friend of mine and I watched the movie “Fight Club” in high school. Prior to this movie she was going to pursue a career in art. Everything she had done in life had been in the refinement of her painting techniques. Her art was often praised by teachers and peers alike. However the act of watching this movie stimulated questions within her that she needed to know the answer to. She is now a psychologist pursuing a career in understanding the human mind and she absolutely loves it.
	The point I would like to emphasis here is that even if reality is an “illusion” that fact that it exists means that it has an influence. This influence needs to be held with respect and dignity in its own right. Your existence in the illusion is evidence of the influence it imposes. Another way to look at it is if you are me and vice versa then why would you treat yourself like shit? 
	So, what does this mean? If everything is one, even the illusionary nature of Maya, then where do I fit into it? Why do I experience plurality? Well my answer is quite simple in thought. The manifestation of me in this form, the form of which I have my own thoughts and opinions, is not separate from everything else but merely a small portion of it. To begin to comprehend infinity, first I must know what it means when I say I have ten of something. When I understand what having ten of something means I can then expand on that, add and subtract from it. The more I confer with this notion of the finite the more I can begin to understand and respect what it truly means to be infinite in nature. If Brahman is void of attributes then first I must understand what attributes are. In the pursuit of understanding what non plurality is then I have to understand my existence of plurality.
	The segregation of existence into three distinct levels; reality, illusion, and non-reality; may initially seem contradictory to trying to understand the non-plurality of Brahman. However I believe that understanding these distinctions and the exploration of them are a way for those with separate consciousness to grasp at a notion of Brahman. These “levels” allow us to explain how our perceived reality works. It allows us the opportunity to study it and search for this fundamental oneness. One could ask the question “Isn’t there a faster way? Can’t I just skip all these steps of understanding? Isn’t it just a waste of time?” Well my friend, what would you gain from “speeding” up the process? If Brahman is attribute less then what is time? Time is an attribute. So whether it takes me one lifetime or ten thousand life times to understand Brahman the “time” devoted is a non-issue. So instead of taking a nihilistic approach I will choose to just enjoy the process of understanding. I choose to flow through the plurality of our experience rather than to oppose it. 
In conclusion, the Advaitins' perspective on the origin of plurality and levels of reality presents a complex and thought-provoking philosophical inquiry. Central to their ideology is the concept of Brahman, the singular essence of all existence, and Maya, the illusion that gives rise to plurality. Through metaphors like the rope and the snake, Advaitins illustrate how ignorance obscures the true nature of reality, which can only be revealed through understanding. The analogy of the blind philosophers and the elephant elucidates how our understanding of Brahman is inherently limited by our individual perspectives. The analogy of differentiation and integration, borrowed from calculus, underscores the importance of navigating the illusionary qualities of reality while upholding ethical principles.
Ultimately, the pursuit of understanding Brahman involves embracing the plurality of experience and exploring the distinctions between reality, illusion, and non-reality. Rather than seeking shortcuts, the journey towards understanding is viewed as a meaningful process worthy of engagement. Thus, Advaitin philosophy invites individuals to flow through the complexities of existence, embracing plurality while seeking the underlying oneness of Brahman.
