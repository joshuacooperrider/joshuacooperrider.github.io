## The Problem
Selling art and networking as a freelance artist is difficult. Using social media to showcase and advertise sounds like a great start, 
however it is easy to get lost in the sea of profiles on social media sites. The majority of them are upstarts, people trying to become 
famous, people looking to socialise, and just a general medley of different use cases. We want to create a platform that specifically 
brings artists together, from amateurs to professionals, to showcase, advertise, and sell their products.

## Use Case Ideas

When a user enters the website, they are able to view the revolving gallery and are able to login or create an account, and search for 
art/artists to purchase from. Account creation allows the user to create either an artist account where they will be able to display 
their products, make connections with other artists, and collaborate on art projects or create a consumer account where they will be 
able to connect with artists for purchasing artwork, write and post reviews about specific artists, and follow artists of their 
choosing. A user’s profile may contain basic info such as name/handle, brief introduction, preferred contact, social media links, and a 
showcase of art they have created and wish to sell.



## Beyond the basics
Gallery - Each user may display a gallery on their page that can host their completed works or things they are currently working on.

Showcase: A set of users (let’s say 5 or so) are featured on the homepage with a profile card of each user's gallery, and clicking the profile card links to that user's page.

Collaboration: Artists can collaborate on projects by joining an organization. This would be similar to GitHub's organization system.

Showcase monthly competitions or special events: An example of this would be Inktober during the month of October, where different artists can showcase their work each day as a challenge and help encourage them to draw every day for that specific month. 

Friends list: Be able to add other artists in the community as a friend

Chat Box: Let other artists communicate with each other on our website

Artist ratings: Implementation of a user's “Artist score/rating” via database in PostgreSQL
