### Introduction

AI use in education can be seen as a double-edged sword. When used correctly, it can be an invaluable tool—helping expand on taught concepts, explore specific topics in greater detail, and identify individual weak points. However, it’s easy to become overly reliant on AI as a crutch for solving problems. Most challenges students encounter have been solved countless times before, making AI an efficient source of ready-made solutions. But this becomes problematic when students are faced with novel or unsolved problems. If they’ve come to depend entirely on AI for answers, they may struggle to adapt, especially when the AI itself cannot provide a clear or verifiable solution.

In the context of software engineering, and specifically in ICS 314, I’ve used tools like Co-Pilot and ChatGPT to offload repetitive coding tasks and to better understand complex systems. For example, integrating a database like Supabase can be frustrating and intricate. ChatGPT has helped me debug obscure issues, identify tiny syntax errors like missing commas or semicolons, and implement API routes more confidently. These tools have significantly improved my understanding without overwhelming me. Still, the key is using AI as a supplement, not a replacement. In my experience, treating AI like a knowledgeable peer, acknowledging its limits and asking the right questions, is essential to avoiding overdependence and truly learning.

### Personal Experience

For in-class WODs and hands-on experience, I almost always relied on Co-Pilot’s suggestions when coding in VS Code, especially when it would auto-complete functions or suggest formatting for specific styles of code. Both Co-Pilot and ChatGPT have been extremely helpful in reducing the burden of writing boilerplate or cookie-cutter code. I haven’t used AI for essays since those assignments are based on personal experience, where AI input doesn’t add much value.

For the final project, however, I’ve used AI extensively for troubleshooting, such as decoding specific error messages, and for gaining a deeper understanding of how to interact with and integrate databases into our project. When learning a brand-new concept or following a tutorial, I intentionally avoid using AI at first because I believe struggling through the basics is an essential part of the learning process. I typically only bring in AI later, once I want to dive deeper or see more tailored examples. I also don’t use AI when participating in class or on Discord, since it defeats the purpose of asking a genuine question. That said, I do use ChatGPT or Co-Pilot to explore different implementations of a function and understand the pros and cons of each. I usually turn to AI when I already grasp the concept but want to skip over repetitive work. For documentation, I don’t rely on AI because I see it as an opportunity to explain what the code should do in my own words—and to ensure that it actually does.

### Impact on learning and understanding

AI has supplemented my learning and understanding by allowing me to focus on the bigger picture of a topic such as how or why something works. It also has allowed me to engage in more in-depth problem solving by challenging me to be able to explain a problem efficiently and cohesively. 

### Practical Applications

I mainly use AI for coding and learning.  I believe it has the potential to be a powerful tool in other applications, I just have not been in any situations where I felt it could be beneficial outside of learning. 

### Challenges/Limitations

One of the biggest challenges is to not become overly reliant on AI. It is a tool that should be used to supplement the learning experience but not to outsource the learning itself.

### Future Considerations

I believe the use of AI in software engineering courses can lead to an accelerated learning experience if it is used in a supplemental way. Like I said earlier it allows the student to focus on big picture ideas and to focus efforts on areas they may need more help in while still being able to keep up with the course. 

### Conclusion

In conclusion, my experience with AI in education, particularly in software engineering, has shown that it can be an incredibly effective tool when used intentionally and with awareness of its limitations. Tools like ChatGPT and Co-Pilot have helped me streamline repetitive coding tasks, troubleshoot errors, and deepen my understanding of complex systems like database integration. However, the key has always been to use AI as a supplement, not a substitute, for learning. It should support the development of problem-solving skills, not replace them. As AI continues to evolve, I believe its role in education will grow, but its greatest value will always lie in empowering students to think critically, explore deeply, and focus on mastering concepts that truly matter.
